It significantly speeds up the creation of IT strategy documents, quarterly reports, and project proposals, helping me articulate complex ideas clearly and efficiently.</li>
                  <li><strong>Excel Insights:</strong> While I don't do deep data science, Copilot in Excel helps me quickly analyze data from IT operations, budget spreadsheets, or incident reports, extracting trends and insights that I might otherwise miss or take hours to find manually.

It saves me significant time composing messages that still sound genuinely "me."</li>
                  <li><strong>Meeting Note Summaries (for non-work calls):</strong> While Copilot handles work meetings, if I have an external meeting or a personal call that needs quick notes, Fyxer can jump in and provide concise summaries and action points.</li>
